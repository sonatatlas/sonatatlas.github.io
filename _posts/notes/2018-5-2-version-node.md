### Search

brew search node

### find the version...

```
brew install node@8
```

#### End

```
This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@8/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/node@8/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/node@8/include
    
```

I've never thought that it is so much easy, I used to cost lots of time...
