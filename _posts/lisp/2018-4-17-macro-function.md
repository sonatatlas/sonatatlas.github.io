### Compile
- Macro will replate code while compiling, no logic test, just like copy. 
- "Define macro" will not consider the type of parameters
- Macro will output many duplicates in our code, and increase our file size.
- Macro run faster than function, no need pen.
- Function only exsit once, can save our room.
- Function calling need pass parameters, slow speed.
- Function need indicator and address.
