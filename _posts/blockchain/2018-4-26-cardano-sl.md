### Nix
I find nix in the awesome project, haskell based on mix, run anywhere, it's really cool!

### Nix install
Using the scripts, nix will build in path `/nix`, one important thing is nix's authority. We may right use nix just as we build, but for some reason, it doesn't work sometimes... recommand reinstall it and be curious.

### Rocksdb
On CentOS, rocks db compiling different, try [this][2].

### tmux
Work hard with the dependence...
