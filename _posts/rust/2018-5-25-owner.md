# Rust Ownership

```rust
fn foo() {
    let v:Vev<T> = vec![1, 2, 3]
}
```
While `v` enter scope, a new vector will create on the stack. the old value on the last stack will be released.

### `Copy` trait

all the basic type got copy, while the complex not, just like Vec.

```rust
let a: i32 = 5;
let b = a;
println!(a)
```

`a` can move, because `a` has `COPY` trait.
