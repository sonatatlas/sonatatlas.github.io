title: How to GraphQL
---

Gatsby's data layer is powered by GraphQL. If you're new to GraphQL, this section may feel a little overwhelming.

# Data in Gatsby

Store data outside components and then bring the data into the component as needed.

Data can also live in file types like Markdown, CSV, etc. as well as databases and APIs of all sorts.

__Gatsby's data layer let us pull data from these (and any other source) directly into our components -- in the shape and form we want.__


# How Gatsby's data layer uses GraphQL to pull data into components

Gatsby uses GraphQL to enable components to declare the data they need.

# Our first GraphQL query

To graphql in gatsby, we have to ensure data has been written in  `gatsby-config.js` :

```javascript
module.exports = {
    siteMetadata: {
        title: `Blah Blah Fake Title`,
    }
}
```

and in the file, that we graphql, like `src/pages/about.js`:

```
export default ({data}) =>(
    <div>About { data.site.siteMetadata.title }</div>
)

export const query = graphql`
    site {
        siteMetadata {
            title
        }
    }
`
```
make sure you write the code above, or error comes


# Where did the graphql tag com from?

The short answer is this:   
during the Gatsby build process, GraphQL queries are pulled out of the original source for parsing.

The longer answer is a little more involved:   
Gatsby borrows a technique from [Relay][relay] that converts our source code into an [abstract syntax tree (AST)][ast] during the build step. All graphql-tagged templates are found in `file-parser.js` and `query-compiler.js`, which effectively removes them from the original source code. This means that the `graphql` tag isn't executed the way that we might expect, which is why there's no error, despite the fact that we're technically using an undefined tag in our source.

# Introducing GraphQL

We can access GraphQL IDE at http://localhost:8000/___graphql.  

# Source plugins

Add `gatsby-source-filesystem` and explore how it works.

```
yarn add gatsby-source-filesystem
```

`gatsby-config.js`:  

```
plugins: [
    {
        resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
        options: {
            name: `src`,
            path: `${__dirname}/src/`,
        },
    },
]
```

# Build a page with a GraphQL query

Create a new file at `src/pages/my-files.js` with the `allFile` query we just created:  

```javascript
import React from "react"

export default ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data)
  return <div>Hello world</div>
}

export const query = graphql`
  query MyFilesQuery {
    allFile {
      edges {
        node {
          relativePath
          prettySize
          extension
          birthTime(fromNow: true)
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

If you visit the new page at `/my-files/` and open up your browser console you will see the data we've query.  

```jsx
import React from "react"

export default ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data)
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Site's Files</h1>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>relativePath</th>
            <th>prettySize</th>
            <th>extension</th>
            <th>birthTime</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {data.allFile.edges.map(({ node }, index) =>
            <tr key={index}>
              <td>
                {node.relativePath}
              </td>
              <td>
                {node.prettySize}
              </td>
              <td>
                {node.extension}
              </td>
              <td>
                {node.birthTime}
              </td>
            </tr>
          )}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  )
}

export const query = graphql`
  query MyFilesQuery {
    allFile {
      edges {
        node {
          relativePath
          prettySize
          extension
          birthTime(fromNow: true)
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

# Transformer plugins

Add a Markdown file to our site at `src/pages/sweet-pandas-eating-sweets.md`(This will become our first Markdown blog post) and learn how to transform it to HTML using transformer plugins and GraphQL.  

Once you save the file, look at `/my-files/` again -- the new Markdown is in the table. This is a very powerful feature of Gatsby. Like the earlier `siteMetadata` example, source plugins can live reload data. `gatsby-source-filesystem` is always scanning for new files to be added and when they are, re-runs your queries.

Pandas are really sweet.
Here's a video of a panda eating sweets.

```

Add a transformer plugin that can transform Markdown files:
```
yarn add gatsby-transformer-remark
```

Then add it to the `gatsby-config.js` like normal:

```js
plugins: [
    `gatsby-transformer-remark`
]

```

# Create a list of our site's Markdown files in `src/pages/index.js`

Like with the `src/pages/my-files.js` page, replace `src/pages/index.js`
with the following to add a query with some initial HTML and styling.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import g from "glamorous";

import { rhythm } from "../utils/typography";

export default ({ data }) => {
  console.log(data);
  return (
    <div>
      <g.H1 display={"inline-block"} borderBottom={"1px solid"}>
        Amazing Pandas Eating Things
      </g.H1>
      <h4>{data.allMarkdownRemark.totalCount} Posts</h4>
      {data.allMarkdownRemark.edges.map(({ node }) => (
        <div key={node.id}>
          <g.H3 marginBottom={rhythm(1 / 4)}>
            {node.frontmatter.title}{" "}
            <g.Span color="#BBB">â€” {node.frontmatter.date}</g.Span>
          </g.H3>
          <p>{node.excerpt}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export const query = graphql`
  query IndexQuery {
    allMarkdownRemark {
      totalCount
      edges {
        node {
          id
          frontmatter {
            title
            date(formatString: "DD MMMM, YYYY")
          }
          excerpt
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

# Programmatically creating pages from data

Create new pages has two steps:

+ Generate the "path" or "slug" for the page.
+ Create the page.

Two Gatsby APIs `onCreateMode` and `createPages`. These are two workhorse APIs you'll see used in many sites and plugins.  

We do our best to make Gatsby APIs simple to implement. To implement an API, you export a function with the name of the API from `gatsby-node.js`

So let's do that. In the root of our site, create a file named
